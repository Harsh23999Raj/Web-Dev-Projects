Hello, Everyone My name is Harsh Raj.
I am a Front-end Web Developer.
Here are a list of my projects,
there are 2 folders here - Simple Projects and Responsive Projects.
Each Project folder has a video file (.mp4) which shows the working of that project.
I have deployed only the Responsive Projects, they can be accessed via the given link - https://app.netlify.com/teams/harsh23999raj/overview
All responsive projects are working.
NOTE - All projects have been verified by me and is fully working, if a project doesn't work then surely it must have exceeded the number of API usage. It gets reset every month.
For any queries, feel free to contact me on Whatsapp- +91 9931102686
